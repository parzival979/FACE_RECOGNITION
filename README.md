# Face Recognition Model Using Tensorflow 

### This is a simple face recognition model using Tensorflow and a neural network architecture

### The model used is [Imagenet Mobilenet V2](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5)

### The model is trained on [Pins Face Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hereisburak/pins-face-recognition) which has approximately 17k images of 105 notable personalities

### The trained model can then be used to predict the face of a person in a given image from the dataset to an accuracy of 90%

### a web app using flask is also created to demonstrate the model
